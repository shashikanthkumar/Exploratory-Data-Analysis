This study investigates the complex relationship between students' academic 
performance and their socioeconomic status (SES) and classroom behavior using 
Python for data analysis. The dataset comprises various indicators, including 
family income, parental education levels, and occupation types to represent SES, 
and attendance records, participation levels, and disciplinary actions to assess 
classroom behavior.
Employing Python's robust data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, and 
scikit-learn, we conduct extensive statistical analyses and apply machine learning 
models to uncover patterns and correlations. Our results demonstrate a significant 
influence of socioeconomic factors on academic outcomes, with notable 
performance disparities associated with income levels and parental education. 
Furthermore, we find that classroom behavior significantly mediates academic 
performance, where positive behaviors correlate with higher achievement levels. 
Interestingly, students from higher SES backgrounds exhibit more favorable 
classroom behaviors, further boosting their academicÂ success.
